These validators are then mapped to the corresponding controls during export and on-the-fly in FormDev.\\n  \\n  To achieve this, you need:\\n  \\n  * An Excel file (an example is attached) located with the form definition and ending with \\"*.mapping.xlsx.\\"\\n  * A configuration JSON file also located with the form definition (an example is attached):\\n  \\n  ```json\\n  {\\n      \\"fieldsToMap\\": [\\n          {\\n              \\"fieldName\\": \\"data-win-options.validator\\",\\n              \\"columnName\\": \\"D\\"\\n          }\\n      ],\\n      \\"idColumn\\": {\\n          \\"name\\": \\"A\\",\\n          \\"startRow\\": 2\\n      },\\n      \\"worksheetName\\": \\"Mapping\\"\\n  }\\n  ```\\n  \\n  `{ \\"fieldsToMap\\": [ { \\"fieldName\\": \\"data-win-options.validator\\", \\"columnName\\": \\"D\\" } ], \\"idColumn\\": { \\"name\\": \\"A\\", \\"startRow\\": 2 }, \\"worksheetName\\": \\"Mapping\\" }`\\n  \\n  You could set these fields described in the JSON via the exporter\'s CLI options, but the above method is recommended.\\n  \\n  However, what needs to be set through the exporter\'s CLI is the flag `--mapExcelFields=true`:\\n  \\n  \\n  ```\\n  npm run export -- --formDefPath=../../../Shared/FormDefinitions/area.PolizeiDE-TH/OWOZGInc_AndereStrafanzeige --outputPath=../../../Shared/FormDefinitions/area.PolizeiDE-TH/Exported --mapExcelFields=true\\n  ```  \\n  Documentation: [read more](/docs/9.5/formdev/devtools#excel-field-mapper)  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-8781: Character length restriction for uploaded files** *(Task)*  \\n  ```html\\n  <var data-hf\\n    data-hf-maxfilenamelength=\\"20\\">\\n  </var>\\n  ```  \\n  Documentation: [read more](/docs/9.5/form-definition/variables#max-filename-length)  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-8782: FormControl FileUploader: Support for video and audio files settings** *(Task)*  \\n  There are now new options for the fileuploader control that has been added especially for audio and video files:\\n  \\n  ```\\n  minDurationSec\\n  maxDurationSec\\n  minVideoPixel\\n  maxVideoPixel\\n  ```  \\n  Documentation: [read more](/docs/9.5/form-controls/fileuploader)  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-8837: Set a filename character whitelist for all text formcontrol inputs** *(Task)*  \\n  Use this option to set a white list of allowed characters for all media files the user is uploading. You can use the regular expression or the string version of the white list. If both are provided the regular expression is used. Optionally you can provide your own error text for the invalid character error message. If you want to give the user a hint what characters are not accepted in the current input you can use the placeholder `{0}` in your error text (E.g: \\"The following characters are invalid: 0\\"). You can also provide translation keys. If no error text is provided a default error message is used.\\n  \\n  ```html\\n  <var data-hf-name=\\"MediaSettings\\"\\n    data-hf-characterWhiteListRegExp=\\"[a-zA-Z0-9\xe4\xf6\xfc\xdf\xc4\xd6\xdc\\\\-.,;:*![](@#%&()?\'`+=]\\" data-hf-characterWhiteList=\\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\xe4\xf6\xfc\xdf\xc4\xd6\xdc\\\\-.,;:*)@#%&()?\'`+=\\" data-hf-invalidCharacterErrorText=\\"{{@InvalidCharsErrorText}}\\">\\n  </var>\\n  ```\\n  \\n  Additionally, two properties can be set on the File Uploader:\\n  \\n  ```\\n  allowedCharacters: \'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\', \\n  allowedCharactersRegExp: \'[a-zA-Z0-9]\'\\n  ```\\n  \\n  The allowed characters for the File Uploader are determined as follows:\\n  \\n  1. If the whitelist property is set in the data-win-options of the FileUploader, this setting is used.\\n  1. Next, it is  checked if Media-Settings are defined, and if so, those are used.\\n  1. If no MediaSettings are defined, it is checked if FormSettings are defined.\\n  1. Otherwise, all characters are allowed.  \\n  Documentation: [read more](/docs/9.5/form-definition/variables#character-white-list-1)  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-8785: Added logout section to debug overlay** *(Task)*  \\n  Implemented a logout section within the debug overlay, enhancing debugging capabilities by providing a dedicated space for logout-related information.

As this led to data loss, we have changed this behavior:\\n  \\n  * Invalid fields are still marked in red when opening the form, an error message is displayed (if available), BUT the field value is not deleted in the background. The invalid input remains, but it must be manually corrected by the user to complete the form.\\n  * **Dropdowns and Comboboxes:**\\n    * If the catalog is not present or if the oData source couldn\'t be loaded: No deletion of the associated data structure occurs. A yellow highlight is displayed with a custom error message: \\"Catalog could not be loaded. Please try again later or contact your administrator.\\"\\n  Completion is also not possible in this case.\\n    * If the catalog or oData source is present but the value is not found in the data source, the ComboBox/Dropdown behaves the same as described above: It is marked in red with an error message, but the associated field data is not deleted.  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-8844: Changed default setting of audio feedback of FormButtons** *(Task)*  \\n  Adjusted the default setting for audio feedback on FormButtons, with the new default being set to \\"off.\\" This change aims to provide a more muted auditory experience by default, offering users a quieter interaction with FormButtons.  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-8870: Automatically sync all added media library files.** *(Task)*  \\n  From now on, the form gets automatically synched immediately after adding new media elements. This should avoid synching conflicts.  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-8878: [BREAKING CHANGE]: Filename length now includes the length of the extension** *(Bug)*  \\n  Until know any filename length validation have not included the lenght of the extension. this has been changed.   \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n### Fixed\\n\\n* **HFF-7198: Fixed disabled condition visibility in PDF** *(Task)*  \\n  Improved display of Conditions with \\"else\\" type set to \\"disabled\\" for a more accurate representation.  \\n  Tags: `PDF` \\n\\n* **HFF-8721: Bugfix: Form-Backup could not be downloaded** *(Bug)*  \\n  Tags: `Core` \\n\\n* **HFF-7432: Fixed memory leak of iOS App if many forms are synced** *(Bug)*  \\n  Tags: `iOS` \\n\\n* **HFF-7645: Fixed DropDownList opening behavior on tablets** *(Bug)*  \\n  Corrected DropDownList opening behavior on tablets to address an issue where errors occurred when the keyboard was open.
